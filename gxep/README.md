# GXEP
_a command line tool to search XML files for a given XPath expression_

## Status
Currently work in progress, the goal is to mimic grep as close as possible.

It can only parse HTML files for now.

## Roadmap
1. Implement directory recursion, not following symlinks
2. Implement directory recursion, following symlinks
3. Find out if the line number can be displayed, or at least a direct XPath to address the location of the match
4. Implement Python interface so this can be used as a module
5. Support XML and provide a switch to handle XML/HTML respectively
7. Deploy to Pypi?
6. A GUI?
